Navigating System Using Floyd - Warshell Algorithm in C++

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a fundamental solution in graph theory for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. This project explores the theoretical foundations, implementation, and practical applications of the algorithm. By employing dynamic programming, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm systematically updates a distance matrix to reflect the shortest paths through intermediate vertices. It supports graphs with negative edge weights, provided there are no negative cycles, making it suitable for a wide range of real-world problems such as network routing and urban navigation systems. The algorithm's cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)) is efficient for dense graphs with a moderate number of nodes. This report presents a detailed analysis of the algorithm's structure, performance, and limitations, supported by implementation examples and test cases.
This Campus Navigator project uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of locations on a campus. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to precompute the shortest paths between every pair of campus locations (vertices in a graph). Once this precomputation is done, the navigator can quickly answer user queries about the shortest distance and the path between any two given locations.
